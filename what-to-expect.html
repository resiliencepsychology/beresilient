      What to expect

    <p>
      So you've decided to take the first step and see a psychologist. That's fantastic as it's sometimes a scary step to take. But just remember you have done the right thing and the psychologist you are 
about to see is a trained professional who has met hundreds of people just like you.

      The first session usually is about getting to know you and what brings you to therapy. The psychologist typically asks some questions about your background, current situation and the symptoms you have been experiencing. The psychologist will give you a chance to talk about what's important to you and what you feel you need help with. It's okay being unsure where to start as the psychologist will help guide you. Remember it's your life and you know it best.

      Now some myth busting. A session is not like a Hollywood movie: you don't have to lie down on a couch and talk about your childhood. It doesn't mean that you're "mad" if you have chosen to see a psychologist, nor does it mean that you are a weak person. In fact it actually suggests that you are courageous enough to make some important changes in your life.

      Towards the end of the first session the psychologist is likely to make some suggestions about what may help. This will incorporate various evidenced based therapies or strategies that are likely to suit you.

      In essence psychological therapy is helping you to understand your thoughts, feelings and behaviours that might be getting you a bit stuck at the moment and then helping you to learn new ways of managing these thoughts, feeling and behaviours so you can live a more fulfilled and rewarding life.

      The amount of sessions required varies depending on what the issues are, how long they have been going on for and the extent to which they are impacting on your life. Typically most people require 4 &ndash; 10 sessions to make meaningful progress. Remember the sessions are totally confidential.

      We look forward to meeting you soon!
