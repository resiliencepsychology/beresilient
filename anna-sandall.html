      Testimonials</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      I would like to endorse the outstanding abilities of Dr Anna Sandall as a Clinical Psychologist. She was excellent at listening, comprehending, and prescribing a practical course of action to address my phobia.
      </p>
      <p>
      She was able to co-ordinate my existing self-knowledge into a highly practical plan that included goal-setting, exposure, cognitive behavourial therapy and mindfulness. I highly recommend Dr Anna Sandall, and thank her for the difference she has made to improving my confidence and consequently, to a huge reduction of anxiety in my life as a whole.
      </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I have found my sessions with Anna to be very beneficial. Her reassurance set me at ease from day one, allowing me to express exactly how I felt without ever feeling judged. With Anna's help I truly believe that I will overcome my anxiety and depression and the strategies that I have learnt under her care will remain with me for life. I cannot thank her enough.
      </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
      Supportive, thoughtful and empowering. I was given new techniques to stop putting myself in such an exposed position. I was supported and encouraged to use new skills that will hopefully reduce the risk of such episodes. Simply put, counselling and therapy have saved my life and Anna is one of those extraordinary souls helping to make that possible.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>

      Thanks for the support Anna. You've got a great way with people, and a personalised friendly and relaxed approach that immediately put me at ease and helped me be able to talk openly and honestly.
